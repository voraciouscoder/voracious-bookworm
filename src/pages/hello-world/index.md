Exciting news!!! My book blog has a new home!
It even has a grown-up domain name (grown-up because I have to pay for it).

Now that things are setup, I'm looking forward to writing more.
Even more so that it'll be in my favourite (arguably archaic) text-editor.

Anyway, here's a cat I met today! :basketball:
