    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my piece of the interwebs canvas! I paint it with book reactions, lists, and other literary things. I grew up on Meg Cabot and mysteries, but have since expanded my reading horizons by participating in reading challenges.</p>
  <p>My favourite reading challenge is the yearly Book Riot <a href="https://bookriot.com/2017/12/15/book-riots-2018-read-harder-challenge/">Read Harder Challenge</a>. So far, I've completed the challenges for 2016, 2017, 2018.</p>
  <p>I only buy books on trips or when I can't get it from the library. If I order a book, it's through my local independent bookstore, both to support it and since I love the anticipation of waiting for a book to arrive.</p>
  <p>I prefer dogs to cats, tea to coffee, hate movie theatres, love improv comedy and basketball, but nothing beats a good book.</p>
  <p>Happy reading!</p>
